#### Detail view

When you select a project you'll see a detail screen

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7kkpnU7.png" width="500" height="auto" >

Here you could run commands in terminal-like view or via shortcut icons, left to right, which include:

* Open in VS Code ( </> icon )
* Open git repo in browser
* List contents
* Open project in your OS file manager
* Open in your OS's terminal
* Clear the terminal like view
  * Can also type `clear` in the input as you would a normal terminal
* Open a project's Salesforce org
* Quickly run ```git status```
* Quickly view the projects README (below under "Readme Example" is a screenshot )
* Archive and backup repos
  * ignores /node_modules, /dist, /out by default
  * offers to delete repo after backup
* Delete repo
  * Will confirm prior to actually moving to your trash

[*] Any command with output, like list contents, goes in the terminal like view, with project name & date time stamp, which you can go back to, copy, etc

### Potential Issues

#### MacOS

This isn't currently being built for MacOS however it would be fairly straitforward for someone to do so leaving this here from VS Code docs:

The 'Open in VS Code' feature expects `code` to be a cli command but [VS Code docs state](code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line) users on macOS must first run a command (Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH) to add VS Code executable to the PATH environment variable. Read the macOS setup guide for help.'
